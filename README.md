# Gas Price Trends Analysis

This project analyzes gas price trends across different countries over time. It provides various visualizations to illustrate how gas prices have evolved, allowing for better understanding and comparison between countries.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
- Seaborn


## Getting Started

To run the code and generate the visualizations:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system:

[Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

2. Clone this repository to your local machine, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/keasamani/Data-Visualisation-project.git
```
```bash
cd gas-price-visualization
```
3. Install the required dependencies using pip in your jupyter notebook:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

4. Run each provided in script (Gas_Price_Visualisation.ipynb) in your preferred Python environment.

Once executed, visualizations will be generated and saved in the project directory.

5. Modify the 'gas_df DataFrame' in each 'code' with your own gas price data if necessary. Ensure that the DataFrame structure remains consistent with the provided example.

6. Customize the plot attributes such as colors, labels, and titles according to your preferences.
